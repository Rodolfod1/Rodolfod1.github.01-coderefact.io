# Homework 01-HTML Git CSS - Code Refactor 

My solution to the code Refactor. 

What i have learned:
- What a semantic tag is and how to structure my HTML (Section , Nav, aside ).
- Getting more familiar with CSS and the embelishment of the final work.
- Comparing reference HTML with the refacted file using google inspector tool for accuracy. 

Challenges during the homework:
- Boxes dimmensions (margin, border, padding)
- understanding of Span. 
- Time administration, i need to learn to estimate how long an activity will take me with the skills I have and where do I need to improve. 

General comment: 
- I have learned so much and have lots of fun learning.
